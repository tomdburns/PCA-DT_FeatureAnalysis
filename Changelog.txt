 Changelog v1.1.0
 
 General Fixes:
 - Fixed bug in PCA.py that caused a crash due to inconsistent label lengths
 - Fixed bug in DT plotting
 - Fixed some plot labels
 - Reduced tree size and added accruacy output from trees (subplot 133)
 - Added a bootstrap function to DecisionTrees.py to calculate the mean
   and CI in subplot 133
 - Added welcome splash to both codes
 - Added optional boostrap to DT code
 - Added progress bars to DT code
 - Fixed a bug that caused errors with sets containing more than 99 features (PCA.py)
 - Added variable called MAX_X to plot_results function of DecisionTree.py, to limit the
   number of features shown in subplot 121 and 122
 
 Specific Changes:
 
 Changes to PCA.py
 - resized label arrays in plot_results() to reduce size of f_labels to match f_x
 - Changed labels in PCA plot to PC 1&2 from PCA 1&2
 - Fixed an error that started the counting of PC at 0 instead of 1 in subplot 222
 - Added code version object
 - Added welcome splash, with code parameters'
 - removed n_components option to PCA class call to fix but with "too many components"
   seen when n_features > 99
 

 
 Changes to DecisionTree.py:
 - Increased default to 10,000 trees from 1,000
 - Added lines of code to rotate the xlabels by 90 degress
 - reduced max depth to 2
 - Added accuracy calculation (see accuracy function) that calculates Balanced
   Accruacy
 - Added array to record BAs from all DecisionTrees
 - increased output to three plots and added subplot at 133 showing dist of
   balanced accuracies
 - Added and implemented a bootstrap function to add CI to subplot 133
 - Added sys import
 - Added progressbar function
 - Added code version object
 - Added welcome splash, with code parameters
 - Added options to toggle Boostrapping, and control the number of boot steps:
   BOOT and BSTEPS
 - Added variable called MAX_X to plot_results function of DecisionTree.py, to limit the
   number of features shown in subplot 121 and 122
